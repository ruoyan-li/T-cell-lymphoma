###   A single cell atlas of T cell lymphoma reveals mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets 
T cell lymphomas (TCL) are a heterogeneous collection of malignancies that are relatively poorly understood and for which few efficacious therapeutic options exist. We have developed a cell atlas of TCL which has revealed interesting facets of these disease entities providing further evidence towards their potential cell of origin, mechanisms of pathogenesis and highlighting novel therapeutic targets. We have conducted single cell RNA sequencing collectively analysing over 180,000 cells from a range of TCL which together with Drug2Cell analysis, spatial transcriptomics, drug screens and functional assessment of cell lines alludes to novel therapeutic targets including SYK inhibitors and TIM3 immunotherapy, and also highlights a key role for activation of T cell receptor (TCR) signalling pathways in disease pathogenesis in some entities, in the absence of an expressed cell surface receptor. Overall, this atlas provides an abundance of data that can be explored towards improved outcomes for patients.
